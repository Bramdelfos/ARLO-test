    "description": "As an Engineer and founder of a data analytics startup, I’ve spent the last years researching the future of my industry to be ahead of everyone else. I’ve been actively iterating my vision for the future of marketing (community building) and digital ownership (WEB3), and it didn’t come as a surprise that Facebook was doing the same. By changing their name to Meta, they are positioning themselves for the next phase of the internet; the Metaverse. Beside questions as what the Metaverse is and why we need/want it, there are more fundamental questions with respect to the ethics and principles with which we want to build this new internet. Do we allow centralized companies to become dictators of our digital worlds, or do we want to recreate and improve our democratic values in our digital lives? The Metaverse bundles many industries in its creation and will revolutionize/disrupt practically everything we know today. The most interesting aspect to me is the possibility to experiment with governance in the digital realm and find ways to improve decision making.",
